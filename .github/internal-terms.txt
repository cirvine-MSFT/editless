# Internal terms list for CI scanning.
# One term per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
# The scan will fail the build if any of these appear in product code.
#
# Note: generic domains like dev.azure.com are NOT listed here because
# the extension legitimately integrates with Azure DevOps via its public API.
# Only add terms that indicate leaked internal references.

# Note: VSCE_PAT / vsce_pat intentionally NOT listed here.
# secrets.VSCE_PAT is the standard way to publish to VS Marketplace
# in GitHub Actions. Scanning for the secret *name* causes false
# positives in workflow files; actual leaked tokens won't match this
# pattern anyway.
