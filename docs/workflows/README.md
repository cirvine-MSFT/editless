# Common Workflows

Step-by-step guides for everyday EditLess tasks. Pick a guide based on what you're trying to do.

## Getting Started

These guides walk you through core EditLess features:

- [Create a new agent or squad](create-agent.md) — Add agents and squads to your workspace
- [Create a session and name it](create-session.md) — Launch a terminal session connected to an agent
- [Open a session from a work item](launch-from-work-item.md) — Start working on a specific issue or task

## Advanced Workflows

- [GitHub Workflow](github-workflow.md) — Managing work with AI agents on GitHub
- [ADO Workflow](ado-workflow.md) — Managing work with AI agents on Azure DevOps

**💡 Tip:** EditLess auto-discovers agents in your workspace. Check the Agents panel — you might already have agents ready to use before you add anything manually.
