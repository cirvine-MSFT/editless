# Create a Session and Name It

Launch a new terminal session with your AI agent and give it a meaningful name so you can stay organized across multiple conversations.

## Steps

1. **Find your agent** in the Agents panel in the EditLess sidebar.

2. **Click the ➕ (Launch Session) button** next to the agent — or right-click and select **Launch Session**.

3. **A new terminal opens** with a Copilot CLI session connected to that agent. The session appears under the agent in the sidebar tree.

4. **Right-click the session** in the sidebar and select **Rename Session**.

5. **Give it a meaningful name** — something that tells you what this session is for. Examples:
   - `Auth refactor`
   - `Bug #42 investigation`
   - `Sprint planning`

6. **The name persists** across VS Code reloads, so you'll always know what each session was about.

7. **Switch between sessions** using `Ctrl+Shift+;` to quickly focus any active session without hunting through terminals.

## 💡 Tip

Name your sessions early and often. When you're running 3–5 agents in parallel, a named session is the difference between "which terminal was working on the API?" and instantly knowing where everything is.
