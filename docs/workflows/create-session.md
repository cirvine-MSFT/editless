# Create a session and name it

Launch a terminal session connected to an agent, then give it a meaningful name.

## Steps

1. In the **Agents** panel (left sidebar), find your agent
2. Click the **Launch Session** button (▶️ icon) next to the agent — or right-click the agent and choose "Launch Session"
3. A new terminal opens with a Copilot CLI session connected to your agent
4. The session appears under the agent in the sidebar tree
5. Right-click the session → **Rename Session** to give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Auth refactor", "Bug #42", "Review PRs")
6. Press Enter — the name sticks around even after you close and reopen VS Code
7. Use `Ctrl+Shift+;` to quickly focus and switch between your sessions

## Session names help you stay organized

Name your sessions based on what you're working on:
- Issue or PR numbers: "PR #234", "Issue #89"
- Task description: "Refactor auth", "Fix typos", "Review design"
- Project context: "Frontend polish", "Docs update", "DB migration"

## Switch between sessions

Press `Ctrl+Shift+;` to bring up a quick-pick menu of all your sessions. Pick one to focus it.

💡 **Tip:** Give each session a name as soon as you create it. It makes multitasking way easier — you'll always know what each session is for at a glance.
