# Create a new agent or squad

Add an agent or squad to your EditLess workspace in seconds.

## Steps

1. In the **Agents** panel (left sidebar), click the **+** (Add...) button in the panel header
2. Choose **Add Agent** or **Add Squad** from the quick-pick menu
3. **For agents:** Enter the path to your agent file (e.g., `.github/agents/my-agent.md`, `.copilot/agents/*.md`)
4. **For squads:** Enter the path to your squad directory (e.g., `.squad/`, `.ai-team/`)
5. Press Enter — the new agent or squad appears in the sidebar tree
6. You're ready to launch sessions!

## How to know if you need this

- You have agents or squads in your workspace that aren't showing up
- EditLess hasn't auto-discovered them yet
- You're adding a new agent or squad and want to register it immediately

## Auto-discovery

EditLess automatically discovers agents in standard locations:
- `.github/agents/`
- `.copilot/agents/`
- `.agent.md` files in your workspace
- Squad directories (`.squad/`, `.ai-team/`)

You might not need to manually add anything — check the Agents panel first.

💡 **Tip:** Once you add an agent or squad, use the **Launch Session** button (▶️) next to it to start working.
