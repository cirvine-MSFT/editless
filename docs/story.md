# The EditLess Story

> *How a rant about terminals became a movement.*

## The One-on-One That Started It All

EditLess was born after a particularly animated one-on-one with my boss.

I had recently dove headfirst into agentic development and vibe coding as a philosophy — without even realizing that's what I was doing. I was ranting and raving about how my productivity had increased tenfold, but I could be *even more* productive if the tools kept up with how I wanted to work with my agents. I kept going on about how Microsoft Teams is going to be the IDE of the future. I wanted a world where I interacted with my agents through multiple chat windows — or even through a phone call in the car on the way to work. Just *talking* to my team and having things happen.

Meanwhile, my computer screen looked more like Dozer's terminal from *The Matrix* than a software development workspace.

Multiple terminals on every screen, multiplexed to the max. And I kept losing track of them — what they were for, what they were working on. I'd have to stop and ask my agents what they were doing, which kind of defeats the purpose of having agents in the first place.

## The Framework That Almost Was

In the weeks leading up to that one-on-one, I had been experimenting with agents and even trying to build my own multi-agent orchestration framework. I didn't understand agentic development well enough to pull it off. The pieces were there — memory systems, multi-agent coordination, task routing — but wiring it all together was a project unto itself.

Then [Squad](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad) came along and blew my mind.

It gave me ninety percent of what the complex framework I was trying to build did — at a minor fraction of the time cost — all while being super fun to use. It incorporated the multi-agent coordination and memory systems I was trying to build, but just did it better and more naturally. I stopped building my framework that day.

## The Moment Everything Changed

I realized that if I wanted to keep my sanity and my productivity climbing, I would need a tool that fit the way I actually worked — one that let me multitask across agents effectively, without drowning in terminal tabs.

My manager asked me how my workflow had changed. And the truth is: things that would have felt normal weeks ago now felt completely archaic and out of date.

Repos? Editors? I hadn't thought about or touched either in weeks. I simply had a team of agents that knew how I wanted them to work, and they were executing my every command with a simple type or voice.
