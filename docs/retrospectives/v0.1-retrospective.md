# EditLess v0.1 Retrospective

**Release Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Tag:** [v0.1.0](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/releases/tag/v0.1.0)  
**Repository:** cirvine-MSFT/editless (public)

## Release Overview

EditLess is a VS Code extension that brings AI agent management, terminal session orchestration, and integrated work item tracking into a unified sidebar experience. The extension turns the "editorless IDE" vision into reality — managing squads, agents, GitHub/ADO work items, and pull requests without ever leaving the sidebar.

**v0.1 by the numbers:**
- **103 closed issues** (including duplicates and scope overlap)
- **96 merged PRs** (including 2 duplicate merges)
- **~275 commits** to master in 3 days
- **200+ tests** across 12 test suites
- **19 source modules** implementing the extension core

This was an aggressive timeline executed by a Squad team working in parallel. The result is a functional extension with deep GitHub + Azure DevOps integration, robust terminal session management, and a working CI/CD pipeline that publishes to the VS Code Marketplace.

## Features Removed or Half-Baked

### Custom Commands (Built, Shipped, Then Removed)
**What happened:** [#16](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/16) implemented "Custom pre-text commands per session" in [PR#24](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/24). The feature allowed users to configure custom shell commands that would be injected before launching a session. [#130](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/130) discovered a critical bug: the config key didn't match the implementation, causing the feature to fail silently. Rather than fix it, [#131](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/131) (P0) completely removed the feature in [PR#134](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/134). [#100](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/100) re-imagined the feature as "inject into chat input, not shell" and moved it to backlog.

**Why it matters:** This is a complete cycle of wasted work — design, implement, ship, discover bug, remove. The feature was never production-ready but made it into the release scope.

**Decision point missed:** Should have caught the config key mismatch in code review or testing before merge.

### Session State Detection (Shipped But Broken)
**What happened:** [#50](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/50) aimed to improve session state detection. [#133](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/133) split "active" into `working` vs `waiting-on-input` vs `idle` in [PR#137](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/137). [PR#173](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/173) fixed detection bugs. [PR#200](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/200) persisted activity state. [PR#236](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/236) changed the default from `waiting-on-input` to `idle` — a design-level admission that the previous default was a false positive.

**Post-release reality:** [#279](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/279) reports that session status icons still don't represent the current state correctly.

**Why it matters:** Four PRs touched session state, yet the feature shipped with known inaccuracy. This suggests the underlying state model is flawed, not just the implementation.

**Decision point missed:** Should have validated the state detection model with real terminal usage patterns before implementation.

### Resume Session Flow (Still Broken at v0.1 Release)
**What happened:** [#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277) (P0, `release:v0.1`) documents that the Resume Session flow needs a complete rework. The issue was filed post-release and remains open.

**Why it matters:** A P0 issue in v0.1 scope that didn't block the release. This was either mis-prioritized or the release gate was too loose.

### Add Agent Flow (Still Broken at v0.1 Release)
**What happened:** [#278](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/278) (P0, `release:v0.1`) documents that the Add Agent flow needs a rework. The issue was filed post-release and remains open.

**Why it matters:** Same as Resume Session — a P0 issue that should have blocked release if the label was accurate.

### Adding a Squad (Buggy and Slow)
**What happened:** [#283](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/283) reports that "adding a squad feels buggy and slow." [PR#248](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/248) claimed to fix "Add Squad correctly adds squad," but clearly didn't resolve the UX issues.

**Why it matters:** The core workflow for adding squads shipped with a poor user experience. Multiple attempts to fix it ([PR#169](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/169), [PR#248](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/248)) didn't fully address the problem.

### Squad Update Detection (Not Working)
**What happened:** [#288](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/288) reports that squad update detection failed to catch a v4.0 → v4.1 upgrade. This is a core feature ([#91](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/91), [PR#145](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/145)) that was supposedly completed and tested.

**Why it matters:** The persistent upgrade indicator feature doesn't work in the wild.

### Parent/Child Work Items (Partially Implemented)
**What happened:** [#10](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/10) added parent-child work item display. [#291](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/291) requests a collapsible tree structure, suggesting the current implementation is flat or non-interactive.

**Why it matters:** Feature shipped but doesn't match user expectations for hierarchical navigation.

### Visual Workflow Docs (Never Started)
**What happened:** [#43](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/43) was labeled `release:v0.1` but never completed. Visual workflow docs with GIFs were planned but never delivered.

**Why it matters:** Release scope included items that were never started. The `release:v0.1` label lost meaning.

### F2 Rename Keybinding (Added, Removed, Removed Again)
**What happened:** F2 keybinding for session rename was added, then removed in [PR#233](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/233) because it was broken, then removed AGAIN in [PR#260](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/260) (the v0.1 release fixes PR).

**Why it matters:** The feature was merged broken, then cleaned up twice. Code review should have caught this before merge.

### Decisions and Recent Activity Views (Not Updating)
**What happened:** [#287](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/287) reports that decisions and recent activity views aren't updating properly.

**Why it matters:** Core Squad integration features shipped non-functional.

### Clicking Session Doesn't Switch Terminal
**What happened:** [#298](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/298) reports that clicking a session in the tree doesn't always switch to the correct terminal.

**Why it matters:** The fundamental UX contract of the extension (click to navigate) is broken in some cases.

### Terminal Session Launch Performance (5s Cold Start)
**What happened:** [#300](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/300) documents that launching a terminal session takes ~5 seconds on cold start.

**Why it matters:** Sluggish performance impacts perceived quality even when features work correctly.

## Duplicate Issues and Duplicate Work

### Duplicate Merged PRs
- **[PR#207](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/207)** and **[PR#210](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/210)** are BOTH titled "fix: deduplicate squads in registry to prevent tree ID collisions" — **literally the same fix merged twice**. This is the most egregious example of coordination failure.

### Duplicate Issues
- **[#11](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/11)** and **[#52](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/52)** both describe the CLI update toast re-appearing on reload.
- **[#12](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/12)** and **[#54](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/54)** both describe sessions not surviving reload.
- **[#84](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/84)** (P0 reconciliation bugs) overlaps with **[#53](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/53)** and **[#54](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/54)** — all three are session persistence issues in the same problem domain.

### Repeated Fixes to the Same Problem
- **F2 keybinding:** Removed in [PR#233](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/233), removed again in [PR#260](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/260).
- **Filter logic:** Fixed in [PR#186](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/186) (AND logic for labels), fixed again in [PR#214](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/214) (AND across categories, OR within same category). Two passes suggest the initial fix was incomplete.
- **Tree ID collisions:** Fixed in [PR#207](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/207), merged again in [PR#210](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/210) (duplicate), fixed more broadly in [PR#235](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/235) (globally unique IDs). Three PRs for the same root cause.
- **Session state:** Split active state in [PR#137](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/137), fixed detection bugs in [PR#173](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/173), persisted activity in [PR#200](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/200), changed default to idle in [PR#236](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/236). Four PRs iterating on the same feature, yet [#279](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/279) says it's still broken.
- **Docs rewrites:** Philosophy doc rewritten in [PR#192](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/192), rewritten again in [PR#221](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/221). README polished in [PR#203](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/203), [PR#205](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/205), and [PR#271](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/271). Multiple rewrites suggest unclear vision early on.

### Coordination Gaps
The duplicate PRs and repeated fixes point to a lack of visibility across parallel workstreams. When Squad members work in isolation, they don't see overlapping work until merge time. The team needs better sync points or issue assignment discipline.

- **[#300](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/300)** — Terminal session launch ~5s cold start (performance)

**What this tells us:** The release shipped with at least 20 known quality issues that impact core workflows. Some have workarounds, but many degrade the user experience in fundamental ways.

## Technical Debt Identified

- **[#246](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/246)** — Reduce coupling and split god objects
  - `extension.ts`: 943 lines, 23 imports, 11+ manager dependencies
  - `editless-tree.ts`: 453 lines, coupled to 9 modules
  - `terminal-manager.ts`: 496 lines, 3 mixed concerns (lifecycle, state, reconciliation)
  - `work-items-tree.ts`: 443 lines, GitHub + ADO coupling
  - `scanner.ts`: 337 lines, doing facade work for multiple subsystems
  - **Goal:** All modules <300 lines, max 8 imports, single-concern design

- **[#247](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/247)** — Fix LLM-generated test antipatterns
  - ~25+ mock-call assertions without result validation (verify mocks are called but not what the code actually does)
  - 16 tautological tests in `work-items-tree.test.ts` (test that code does what it does)
  - 18+ shallow smoke tests (call a function, assert no throw, don't validate behavior)
  - ~40 instances of fragile mock coupling in `extension-commands.test.ts`
  - Missing edge case coverage in `scanner`, `status-bar`, `terminal-manager`
  - 4+ misleading test names (describe intent incorrectly)

- **Repeated Fixes as Debt Indicators:**
  - Tree ID collision fixes ([PR#207](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/207), [PR#210](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/210), [PR#235](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/235)) suggest tree item ID generation logic is fragile
  - Session state fixes ([PR#137](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/137), [PR#173](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/173), [PR#200](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/200), [PR#236](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/236)) suggest the state model is flawed
  - Filter logic fixes ([PR#186](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/186), [PR#214](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/214)) suggest filter abstraction is leaky

- **[#107](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/107) (P0)** — `execSync` blocks activation
  - CLI probing in `activate()` can block the extension host for 15 seconds
  - Must be made async to prevent UI freezes

## What Went Well

### Shipped a Functional Extension
Despite the quality gaps, EditLess v0.1 is a working VS Code extension with real utility:
- Deep GitHub and Azure DevOps integration that pulls work items and PRs into the sidebar
- Terminal session management that survives reloads and crashes
- Agent/squad discovery and orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline that automates builds and marketplace publishing

### Aggressive Parallelism
The Squad team executed 96 merged PRs and closed 103 issues in roughly 3 days. This velocity is remarkable and demonstrates effective parallel work distribution.

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
200+ tests across 12 test suites provide a safety net for refactoring. While [#247](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/247) identifies antipatterns, the sheer volume of tests shows a commitment to quality.

### CI/CD from Scratch
Built a complete CI/CD pipeline ([#67](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/67), [#68](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/68), [#69](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/69), [#70](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/70)) with build validation, security scanning, and automated marketplace publishing. This infrastructure will pay dividends in future releases.

### Successful Public Launch
Transitioned from private prototype to public repo and VS Code Marketplace listing ([#42](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/42)) — a significant milestone that makes EditLess discoverable.

### Documentation Investment
Comprehensive docs ([#34](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/34), [#37](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/37), [#39](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/39), [#47](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/47), [#48](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/48)) provide a strong foundation for onboarding new users and contributors.

### Architectural Wins
- **CLI Provider System** ([#101](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/101), [PR#165](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/165)): Replacing hardcoded logic with a pluggable provider system is the right long-term architecture
- **Session Persistence** ([PR#55](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/55), [PR#157](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/157)): Name-based reconciliation is pragmatic and effective for the use case
- **`.squad/` folder migration** ([PR#154](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/154)): Backward-compatible rename shows good migration design

---

## What Could Improve

### Duplicate Work Wastes Effort
- **[PR#207](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/207) and [PR#210](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/210)** are the same fix merged twice — literal wasted work
- Duplicate issues ([#11](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/11)/[#52](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/52), [#12](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/12)/[#54](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/54)) suggest poor issue triage or lack of visibility

### Features Shipped Then Removed
- **Custom Commands** ([#16](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/16) → [#130](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/130) → [#131](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/131)) went through a full build-ship-remove cycle
- **F2 keybinding** added then removed twice
- These represent wasted implementation effort that should have been caught in design or code review

### Features Need Immediate Rework Post-Release
- **[#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277)** (Resume Session) and **[#278](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/278)** (Add Agent) are both P0 issues requiring rework
- If these workflows were broken enough to need rework immediately after release, they should have blocked v0.1

### Session State Remains a Design-Level Problem
Four PRs ([PR#137](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/137), [PR#173](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/173), [PR#200](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/200), [PR#236](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/236)) iterated on session state detection, yet [#279](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/279) says it's still broken. This suggests the underlying state model is flawed, not just the implementation. Repeated fixes indicate the team is treating symptoms instead of root cause.

### Documentation Rewrites Suggest Unclear Vision
- Philosophy doc rewritten twice ([PR#192](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/192), [PR#221](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/221))
- README polished three times ([PR#203](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/203), [PR#205](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/205), [PR#271](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/pull/271))
- Multiple rewrites indicate the narrative wasn't clear early on

### Release Scope Labels Lost Meaning
- [#43](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/43) labeled `release:v0.1` but never started
- [#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277) and [#278](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/278) labeled `release:v0.1` but still open post-release
- If the label doesn't gate releases, it's just noise

### Code Review Gaps
- **PR#207/PR#210 duplicate merge** should have been caught in review
- **F2 keybinding broken** should have been caught before merge
- **Custom commands config key mismatch** ([#130](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/130)) should have been caught in review or testing

### Test Quality vs. Test Quantity
[#247](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/247) identifies pervasive test antipatterns:
- Mock-call assertions without result validation (test that mocks were called, not that code works)
- Tautological tests (test that code does what it does)
- Shallow smoke tests (call a function, assert no throw)

**The problem:** 200+ tests provide false confidence. High line coverage doesn't mean high quality. The suite checks that code runs but doesn't validate that it behaves correctly.

### Coordination Gaps Between Parallel Workstreams
Duplicate PRs and repeated fixes suggest Squad members lacked visibility into overlapping work. With 96 PRs in 3 days, it's easy for parallel work to collide. The team needs better sync points or clearer issue assignment to prevent redundant effort.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Rethink Session State Model
Stop iterating on the implementation and revisit the state model itself. Four PRs and ongoing bugs ([#279](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/279)) suggest the abstraction is wrong. Consider:
- Simplify to fewer states (do we really need `working`, `waiting-on-input`, AND `idle`?)
- Define state transitions explicitly (what events trigger state changes?)
- Validate the model with real terminal usage before implementing

### 2. Tighten Code Review Standards
Require reviewers to check:
- Does this PR duplicate an existing fix?
- Does this feature work end-to-end (not just "does it compile")?
- Are configuration keys consistent with implementation?
- Do tests validate behavior, not just mock calls?

### 3. Gate Releases on P0 Issues
If an issue is labeled P0 and `release:vX.Y`, it must be resolved before that release ships. Either fix it, downgrade the priority, or remove the release label. Don't ship with open P0s.

### 4. Improve Test Signal-to-Noise
Address [#247](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/247) by rewriting tests to:
- Validate actual behavior, not just mock calls
- Cover edge cases and failure modes
- Use descriptive names that match intent

**Refactor guideline:** If a test doesn't catch real bugs, it's noise. Delete it or fix it.

### 5. Use Issue Labels Consistently
If `release:v0.1` means "must ship in v0.1," enforce it. If it means "would be nice to ship," rename it to `target:v0.1` or `proposed:v0.1`. Don't let labels lose meaning.

### 6. Establish Sync Points for Parallel Work
With a Squad team working in parallel, add lightweight coordination:
- Daily "what are you working on?" check-ins (async in chat)
- PR titles must reference issue numbers (makes duplicates visible)
- Assign issues before starting work (prevents collisions)

### 7. Validate Core Workflows with Real Usage Before Release
The post-release issues ([#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277)–[#300](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/300)) represent UX gaps that should have been caught with manual testing. Add a pre-release checklist:
- Can I add an agent? (happy path + error cases)
- Can I launch a session from a work item?
- Can I resume a crashed session?
- Does the tree update when I click items?

**Don't rely on unit tests alone.** Integration-level UX validation is essential.

### 8. Reduce God Objects
[#246](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/246) identifies `extension.ts` (943 lines, 23 imports) and others as god objects. Break them down:
- Extract cohesive modules with clear boundaries
- Reduce cross-module coupling
- Aim for <300 lines per module

**Why it matters:** Smaller modules are easier to reason about, test, and review. God objects make duplicate work more likely because reviewers can't see the full context.

### 9. Document Design Decisions Before Implementation
The Custom Commands feature ([#16](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/16)) went through build-ship-remove because the design wasn't validated upfront. For future features:
- Write a design doc or RFC before coding
- Get feedback from users (Casey) on UX mockups
- Validate config schema matches implementation

### 10. Invest in Dev Tooling Research Before Building

v0.1 shipped features that duplicated or conflicted with existing ecosystem capabilities — and missed opportunities to leverage them:

- **VS Code's native terminal launcher:** VS Code already has built-in Copilot terminal launch integration. We built our own terminal orchestration without fully understanding what the platform provides out of the box. Research into VS Code's `terminal.integrated.*` APIs and the Copilot CLI's native VS Code hooks could have saved significant effort and avoided features that fight the platform.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI integration points:** We treated GHCP CLI as a black box to shell out to. We didn't research how other extensions integrate with it — what lifecycle hooks exist, what IPC/socket channels are available, whether there are extension APIs for session awareness. Understanding the CLI's extension surface could have informed a cleaner architecture.
- **Squad UI's state reading:** The Squad web UI already reads `.ai-team/` state (team.md, decisions, agent history) to render dashboards. Our "squad at a glance" features (status bar, tree decorations, notifications) reimplemented state parsing from scratch instead of sharing or reusing the patterns Squad UI had already solved. Understanding how Squad UI reads squad state could have reduced code, improved consistency, and given us a head start on features like the dashboard deep-link.
- **Extension ecosystem patterns:** We didn't survey how similar VS Code extensions (GitLens, GitHub Pull Requests, Remote SSH) handle terminal management, tree views, and background processes. Their patterns for lifecycle management, view persistence, and error recovery are battle-tested.

**The lesson:** Before building a feature, spend time understanding what already exists in the platform, the CLI, and the broader ecosystem. Research is cheaper than building, shipping, and removing. A spike that reads VS Code's terminal API docs or inspects Squad UI's state parsing would have saved multiple PRs worth of wasted effort.

### 11. Treat Post-Release Issues as Release Process Failures
Issues [#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277)–[#300](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/300) should have been caught before v0.1 shipped. Do a retrospective on why they weren't:
- Were they not tested?
- Were they tested but dismissed as "acceptable"?
- Were they not discovered until real-world usage?

**Use the answers to improve the release checklist for v0.2.**

---

## Closing Thoughts

EditLess v0.1 is a real achievement — a functional extension with deep integrations, robust persistence, and a working CI/CD pipeline. The Squad team executed at high velocity and delivered a public release in record time.

But the quality gaps are significant. Duplicate PRs, features shipped then removed, P0 issues still open post-release, and core workflows that need immediate rework all point to the same root cause: **speed prioritized over validation**.

For v0.2, the recommendation is clear: **slow down enough to validate quality before merge**. Aggressive parallelism is valuable, but only if the work doesn't collide or regress. Tighten code review, gate releases on real P0s, and test core workflows manually before shipping.

The technical foundation is solid. The architecture decisions (CLI Provider system, session persistence, `.squad/` migration) are right. The docs are comprehensive. The CI/CD pipeline works. The next release should focus on refinement: fix the session state model, rework the broken flows ([#277](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/277), [#278](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/278)), improve test signal, and reduce coupling ([#246](https://github.com/cirvine-MSFT/editless/issues/246)).

Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity: **we didn't research before we built.** VS Code has native terminal integration for Copilot. Squad UI already reads `.ai-team/` state. Other extensions have solved terminal lifecycle, tree persistence, and error recovery. We reinvented wheels we didn't know existed, shipped features that fought the platform, and missed chances to leverage ecosystem work that would have given us better results with less code. For v0.2, research spikes should precede every major feature.

**v0.1 shipped. v0.2 should ship *well* — and ship *less*.**
