# The EditLess Story

> *Leave the editor for your mind.*

## Why EditLess?

Software development is changing. AI coding agents can write code, run tests, create pull requests, and iterate on feedback — all from a terminal. But managing multiple agents across multiple repos? That's a mess of terminal tabs, lost context, and "wait, which agent was working on the auth module?"

EditLess was born from a simple observation: **the best developers using AI agents spend most of their time planning, delegating, and reviewing — not editing code.** They need a command center, not a code editor.

## The Philosophy

### Edit Less, Effortless

EditLess is built on the belief that editing code is becoming optional. Not because code doesn't matter, but because the act of typing it is no longer the bottleneck. The bottleneck is decision-making:

- What should we build?
- How should we architect it?
- Is this PR correct?
- What's the right tradeoff?

These are human decisions. Everything else can be delegated.

### Plan, Delegate, Review

This is the EditLess loop:

1. **Plan** — decide what needs to happen, break it into work items
2. **Delegate** — assign work to your AI agents, launch sessions, provide context
3. **Review** — check PRs, approve decisions, course-correct

You're the engineering manager. Your agents are the team. EditLess is your dashboard.

### Progressive Detection

EditLess doesn't assume anything about your setup. Features light up as tools are discovered:

- No CLI tools? You get terminal management.
- Copilot CLI detected? You get agent session launching.
- Squad team found? You get roster views, decisions, activity tracking.
- GitHub repos configured? You get work items and PRs.

Nothing shows unless it's relevant. The sidebar stays clean.

## The Vision

*"Microsoft Teams is the IDE of the future."*

Today, the best engineering managers don't write code — they coordinate. They're in meetings, reviewing architecture, unblocking their teams. AI agents make this possible for individual developers too.

EditLess is the first step toward a world where your VS Code sidebar looks less like a file explorer and more like a project dashboard. Where you open VS Code not to edit files, but to manage your team of AI agents working across your repos.

*Join the editorless software development revolution.*
