# The Editorless Philosophy

> *Escape the editor. Free your mind.*

## The Shift

The way developers work with AI has fundamentally changed, but our tools haven't caught up.

Five years ago, you opened VS Code to write code. That was the center of your day — the editor was where the work happened. But today? If you're working with capable AI agents, you're not writing code. You're deciding *what* should be written, *how* it should work, and *whether* it's correct. You're planning. You're delegating. You're reviewing.

The editor isn't the bottleneck anymore. **Decision-making is.** And decisions don't happen in an editor — they happen in conversation.

## The Three-Act Play: Plan, Delegate, Review

Editorless development follows a rhythm:

**Plan.** You decide what needs to happen. You think about the architecture, the trade-offs, the acceptance criteria. You break work into discrete tasks that an AI agent can execute autonomously.

**Delegate.** You give those tasks to your agents. You launch a session, provide context, and let them work. They run code, iterate on feedback, create pull requests — all while you move on to the next thing.

**Review.** When work comes back to you, you check it. Does the PR look right? Did the agent solve the actual problem, or did it miss the point? You approve, request changes, or redirect. Then you delegate again.

This loop repeats. And it moves *fast*.

When you're doing this well, you spend maybe 10% of your time actually looking at code and 90% thinking about whether it's the *right* code. The editor becomes incidental — something you might open once a week to quickly scan a file, not a place where you spend hours typing.

## The Bottleneck Moved

Here's the key insight: **the bottleneck isn't writing code anymore. It's staying coherent across your agents' work.**

Imagine you have three agents working on three different features in two different repos. Agent A just finished a PR. Agent B is blocked waiting for context about a design decision. Agent C hit an error and needs your help debugging. Meanwhile, there are four terminals running, each one showing different things, and you can't remember which one is for what.

This is the state developers find themselves in when they try to scale from one agent to many. The tools — terminals, tabs, web UIs — haven't evolved for this world. You're drowning in context switches, not actual work.

Editorless development means: **one place to see everything, one place to decide what happens next.**

## Why Conversation Becomes the IDE

Here's why this matters: the IDE of the future isn't going to be a code editor. It's going to be a chat interface where you talk to your team of agents directly.

Think about what you actually do with a great engineering manager. You say: "Hey, we need to add auth to the API. Can you plan it out?" And they come back with a design. You say: "Looks good, but we should add rate limiting to the login endpoint." And they integrate that feedback. You ask: "How's that PR looking?" And they tell you the status.

You're not asking them to show you the code — you're asking them what they did and why. That's conversation. That's the IDE.

EditLess is a step on that path. It brings your agents' work — their sessions, their PRs, their decisions, their activity — into one place where you can see it, talk to it, and act on it. Without context switching. Without drowning in terminals. Without touching the editor unless you actually need to.

## The Vision: Management as a Superpower

Today, the best engineering managers don't write code — they coordinate. They're in meetings, reviewing architecture, unblocking their teams, keeping everyone aligned. That used to be the luxury of senior people on big teams.

AI agents change that equation. Now an individual developer can have a team. You can plan work in parallel, delegate across multiple projects, coordinate reviews from one dashboard. You can spend your day making decisions and delegating, not typing.

We believe this is the future of software development. Not everyone writing code — some people will. But the center of the craft shifting from "how do I write this?" to "who should write this and what are the constraints?"

EditLess is built for that future.

## What This Means for You

If you're working with AI agents and you find yourself living in terminals, jumping between web UIs, forgetting which session was working on what — stop. That's a tooling problem, not a you problem. You shouldn't have to carry that cognitive load.

The editorless approach means: bring all that scattered context back into one place. One window. One sidebar. One source of truth. And then get back to what you're actually good at — making decisions and delegating.
