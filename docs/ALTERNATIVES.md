# Alternatives and Ecosystem

EditLess exists in a growing ecosystem of AI agent management tools. Here are some alternatives worth knowing about:

## Agent HQ

[Agent HQ](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-hq) is a chat-panel-based interface for interacting with AI agents. Where EditLess focuses on terminal session management, work item tracking, and multi-agent orchestration from the VS Code sidebar, Agent HQ provides a conversational chat experience.

**When to use Agent HQ:** If you prefer a chat-first workflow where you interact with agents through conversation.

**When to use EditLess:** If you prefer managing multiple agent sessions, tracking work items, and orchestrating teams from a sidebar — leaving the editor for your mind.

Both tools can coexist. EditLess manages the operational layer (sessions, work items, PRs), while Agent HQ can serve as an alternative interaction surface.

## Other Tools

The AI development tools landscape is evolving rapidly. EditLess is designed to be tool-agnostic — it works with any CLI that launches agents (Copilot, Claude, custom CLIs, and more). As new tools emerge, EditLess aims to integrate with them through its provider system.
