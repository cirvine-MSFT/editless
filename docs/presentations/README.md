# Mark's Journey: Executive Presentation

**Format:** PowerPoint (16:9 widescreen)  
**Audience:** Leadership and high-level customers (non-technical)

## Overview

This presentation tells the story of "Mark," a fictional developer's journey discovering and evolving with agentic AI. It's designed to be completely generic — no company names, product names, or specific tools mentioned.

## Narrative Arc

1. **Title Slide** — "The Developer's Journey to Agentic AI"
2. **The Starting Point** — Mark is happy with his AI coding assistant. "What more do I need?"
3. **The Discovery** — Mark realizes agents can improve themselves, connect to tools, remember context, and coordinate with other agents.
4. **The Disruption** — New tools emerge constantly. Mark's custom system becomes obsolete. The pace of change is relentless.
5. **The Realization** — Mark shifts focus from tools to process: planning, delegation, and review. The developer becomes a manager of AI work streams.
6. **The New Developer** — The craft shifts from "how do I write this?" to "who should write this, and what are the constraints?"
