## Learnings


📌 **Team update (2026-02-16):** Documentation animation strategy — EditLess uses optimized GIFs stored in docs/media/ directory. Primary tool: ScreenToGif (Windows). Files must be <1 MB, max 800px width, 3–8 seconds duration. File naming is descriptive kebab-case (e.g., planning-feature.gif). Re-recording triggers documented: UI structure changes, command/shortcut changes, label changes, layout changes. Team reviews animations on code review checklist. — decided by Summer

📌 **Team update (2026-02-16):** Default release target — All new issues default to elease:v0.1 unless Casey explicitly directs otherwise. This ensures v0.1 work is automatically tagged correctly. — decided by Casey Irvine

📌 **Team update (2026-02-16):** Worktree enforcement reinforced to hard constraint — Git checkout violations (agent on #213 checked out branches on the main clone instead of using worktrees) have happened repeatedly despite existing documentation. The rule is now a non-negotiable constraint enforced through code review: the main clone (C:\Users\cirvine\code\work\editless) is PULL-ONLY, all feature branch work must use git worktrees. Violations must be caught and rejected in PR review. — reinforced by Casey Irvine

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): Squad folder rename — `.squad/` support added with `.ai-team/` backward compatibility via `src/team-dir.ts` utility. Any future code that needs to locate the team directory must use `resolveTeamDir()` or `resolveTeamMd()` — never hardcode paths. — decided by Morty

📌 Team update (2026-02-16): v0.1 Release Triage & Scope Lock — 7 P0 items locked (including session persistence #94), 8 P1 items prioritized. #101 (Generic CLI Provider) flagged for scope review — architectural dependency may require design decision. Scope lock after 15:00 UTC. — decided by Rick

📌 Pipeline update (2026-02-16): Removed `go:` label namespace — `go:yes`, `go:no`, `go:needs-research` all retired. Triage now applies `status:needs-plan` as default (respects existing `status:` labels). Release labels trimmed to `release:v0.1` and `release:backlog` only. Enforcement workflow no longer manages `go:` mutual exclusivity or go→release side effects. — requested by Casey
