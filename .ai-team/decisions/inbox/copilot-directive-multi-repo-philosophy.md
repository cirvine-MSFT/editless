### 2026-02-15: Multi-repo workflow philosophy — don't open repos, open a workspace
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** The EditLess philosophy is: don't open VS Code in a repo. Open it in a central folder and work across multiple repos simultaneously. Think in terms of working with agents, not in terms of an editor tied to one repo. This should be a core part of the documentation and philosophy sections.
**Why:** User directive — this is a fundamental EditLess workflow pattern that changes how people think about their dev environment.
