### 2026-02-15: Recommend Squad as the starting point for new vibe coders
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** Documentation should recommend Squad as the entry point for people new to vibe coding or feeling overwhelmed by the agent landscape. Squad makes it easy and fun. This goes in the recommendations/philosophy docs — if you're new, start with Squad.
**Why:** User directive — many people reaching out are intimidated by the agent landscape. Squad lowers the barrier.
