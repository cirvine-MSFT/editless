### 2026-02-16: Meeseeks writes regression tests for every bug Casey discovers
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** When Casey discovers a bug during usage, Meeseeks should write regression tests for that specific scenario BEFORE Morty fixes it. Tests-first approach for all user-discovered bugs.
**Why:** User request — ensures bugs have proper test coverage and we know exactly what to verify when the fix lands.
