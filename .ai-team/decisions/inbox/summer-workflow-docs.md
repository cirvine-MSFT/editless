# Workflow Documentation Structure

**Decided by:** Summer  
**Date:** 2026-02-16

## Decision

EditLess workflow how-to guides follow a consistent structure to make them easy to scan, write, and maintain.

## Pattern

Each workflow guide:
1. Opens with a one-sentence goal ("Do X in Y steps")
2. Contains 5–8 numbered steps (plain and scannable)
3. Includes a context subsection ("How to know if you need this" or "Why this matters")
4. Placeholder for future GIF: `<!-- TODO: Add GIF recording for this workflow -->`
5. Ends with three sections:
   - 💡 **Tip:** One pro-tip related to the workflow
   - 📖 **See Also:** Links to related docs
   - Back-link: `← [Back to Common Workflows](README.md)`

## Index Structure

The workflows index (`docs/workflows/README.md`) organizes guides into two sections:
- **Getting Started:** New how-to guides (core features)
- **Advanced Workflows:** Integration-specific docs (GitHub, ADO)

## Why This Works

- **Consistency:** New guides fit the pattern automatically
- **Scannability:** Users can find the steps they need in seconds
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new workflows without restructuring
- **Future-proof:** GIF placeholders are explicit; no surprise missing recordings
- **Navigation:** Tip callouts and "See Also" links reduce user friction
