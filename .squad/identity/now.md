# What We're Focused On

Phase 1 of v0.1.1 is wrapping up. Three draft PRs open for review (#364, #366, #367), one merged (#365). Pseudoterminal spike complete — strong recommendation to adopt. Casey's unified discovery directive changes the scope of #317/#318. Next: architecture review based on spike findings, then Phase 2 (terminal reliability work informed by pseudoterminal decision).
