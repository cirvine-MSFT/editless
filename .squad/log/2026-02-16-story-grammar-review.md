# Session: 2026-02-16 Story Grammar Review

**Requested by:** Casey Irvine
**Contributor:** Summer (Documentation Agent)

## What happened

Summer reviewed `docs/story.md` in the docs-vibing worktree for grammar and phrasing issues.

## Changes made

- Fixed "dove" → "dived" (standard English past tense)
- Fixed tense consistency: "would take me weeks before" → "would have taken me weeks before" (past perfect)
- Removed double space (formatting fix)

## Approach

Light-touch edits preserving the personal, conversational voice of Casey's narrative. Fixed clear grammatical errors while maintaining the casual, authentic tone that makes the story compelling.

## Decision documented

See `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/summer-story-style.md` — merged into `decisions.md` this session.
