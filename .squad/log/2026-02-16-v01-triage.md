**Requested by:** Casey Irvine  
**Session:** 2026-02-16-v01-triage  
**Date:** 2026-02-16

## Summary

Rick triaged all 25 open issues for v0.1 release deadline (Monday end of day, ~16 hours).

## Key Outcomes

- **#148 (New P0 bug):** Session labels off by one — assigned to Morty, release-blocking
- **#38 (Squad UI integration):** Moved from v0.1 to backlog — explicitly marked "future work" in issue body
- **#36, #37, #42, #43 (Docs/publishing):** 4 items cut to post-v0.1
- **#96, #101 (CLI provider refactor):** Flagged for scope review, may defer if capacity constrained

## v0.1 Scope Locked

- **7 P0 items:** Ready to implement or actively being worked
- **8 P1 items:** Should ship if squad capacity allows  
- **5 items cut to post-v0.1**
- **Cutoff:** No new v0.1 items after 2026-02-16 15:00 UTC

All P0 assignments and labels completed. Squad can execute with confidence.
