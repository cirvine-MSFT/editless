# Session Log — v0.1.1 Review Cycle

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Time:** 07:15Z–07:20Z  
**Cycle:** v0.1.1 Release Review (3x Pass)  
**Team:** Rick (Lead), Meeseeks (Test Lead), Gemini Fresh Eyes (Independent)  
**Outcome:** APPROVED  

## What Happened

### Pass 1: Rick (Lead Reviewer) — 07:15Z
Rick conducted comprehensive code review of PR #385 (Phase 2 terminal integration). Verdict: **APPROVE** with 3 advisory notes (non-blocking).

**Approved Areas (8):** UUID pre-generation, TerminalOptions config, sendText ordering, focusTerminal overload, file watching (fs.watch), resource cleanup, TypeScript quality, test coverage.

**Advisory Notes:** 
1. Soft validation in relaunchSession—redundant error signals (Priority: Low)
2. Unbounded retry in watchSession.setupWatch()—lifecycle-bounded, acceptable (Priority: Low)  
3. watchSessionDir dead code—forward-looking Phase 3 API (Priority: Informational)

### Pass 2: Meeseeks (Test Lead) — 07:15Z
Test coverage audit completed. 17 coverage gaps identified and filled.

**Test Results:** 654 → 671 passing tests (+17 new). All gaps addressed: terminal lifecycle, session resumability, retry bounds, platform-specific behavior, event debouncing, environment variables, theme icons, terminal options, focusTerminal overload, resource disposal, orphan detection, session streaming, file watch persistent flag, double-dispose safety, console.warn paths, event parsing, terminal close atomicity.

### Pass 3: Gemini Fresh Eyes (Independent) — 07:20Z
Independent code review with fresh perspective.

**Bug Found:** getAvailableOptions not stripping `:f{seq}` suffix from nodeIds → empty filter dropdowns. **Fixed by coordinator in ddcc6a5.**

**False Positive:** Case sensitivity on issue state ('open' string). Ruled out: GitHub API returns lowercase; EditLess only fetches open issues.

## Decisions Made

- PR #385 approved for merge as-is
- Bug fix (ddcc6a5) applied and tested
- Advisory notes deferred to Phase 2 hardening pass
- Test coverage gaps addressed before v0.1.1 release
- Context value naming convention documented (rick-contextvalue-naming.md)

## Test Coverage Summary

- **terminal-manager:** 99 tests ✅
- **session-context:** 38 tests ✅
- **New coverage:** 17 additional tests ✅
- **Total for v0.1.1:** 671 passing tests

## Next Steps
