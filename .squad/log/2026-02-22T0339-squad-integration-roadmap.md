# Squad Ecosystem Integration Roadmap Session

**Date:** 2026-02-22T03:39:00Z  
**Agents:** Rick, Squanchy, Unity  
**Orchestrated by:** Copilot (spawn prompt)

## Summary

Casey's strategic directive ("many frontends, not one") was analyzed and operationalized into a 3-phase, 12-issue Squad ecosystem integration roadmap. Rick created the master roadmap with prioritization and routing. Squanchy deep-dived architecture (session modality, event consumption). Unity researched SquadUI integration surface. All three authored decision briefs ready for merge.

**Immediate outcome:** 12 GitHub issues scoped (Phase 1: 5 issues unblocked; Phase 2: 3 issues research; Phase 3: 4 issues backlog pending Brady's SDK).

## Phase Breakdown

- **Phase 1 (Foundation, v0.2.0):** Modality types, Squad CLI builder, launch commands, attention state, icons
- **Phase 2 (SDK Research, v0.2.x):** Copilot SDK spike, session discovery
- **Phase 3 (Blocked, release:backlog):** EventBus, RalphMonitor, HookPipeline (waiting on Brady)

## Key Decisions Merged

1. **Squad Ecosystem Integration Roadmap** (Rick) — Strategic 3-phase plan with 12 issues
2. **Squad CLI/SDK Integration Architecture** (Squanchy) — Session modality system + file-based event consumption
3. **SquadUI Integration Surface** (Unity) — Tier 1 commands (4h), root sync strategy
4. **User Directive: Squad Integration Strategy** (Casey) — Brady's multi-frontend vision

## Next Steps

1. Merge inbox decisions into decisions.md
2. Create GitHub issues #373–#384 per routing table
3. Assign Phase 1 work to Morty, Summer, Jaguar
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately
