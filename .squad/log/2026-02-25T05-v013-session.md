### Deliverables

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| orchestration-log/2026-02-25T05-v013-triage-and-fixes.md | Created |
| PR #423 (Agent picker + Roster fix) | Approved, merge first |
| PR #424 (ADO config refresh) | Approved, independent |
| PR #425 (Discover/Register UX) | Approved, merge #3 |
| PR #426 (Resume external session) | Approved, merge #4 |
| PR #427 (Squad refresh speed) | Approved, independent |
| decisions/inbox → decisions.md | Merged & deduplicated |

### Key Decisions

1. **v0.1.3 scope expanded:** Issues #417, #418 added (small scope, high impact)
2. **Merge sequence:** #424 → #427 → #423 → #425 → #426 (dependency order)
3. **UX principle:** One icon = one meaning; explicit registration; self-documenting flow
