# v0.1.1 Completion Session — 2026-02-22

**Coordinator:** @copilot  
**Team:** Morty (2 sessions), Summer, Jaguar, Meeseeks, Rick  
**Duration:** Parallel multi-agent orchestration  
**Outcome:** 6 issues closed, PR #385 merged, 133 stale branches cleaned

## Work Completed

### Agent Assignments
- **Morty (Session 1):** #327 Orphan matching — index-based + emoji-stripped matching, removed substring fallback, 9 new tests
- **Summer:** #338 Orphan jargon — replaced "orphaned" with "previous session"/"session ended", updated icons/commands
- **Morty (Session 2):** #280 PR filtering — added "created by me" toggle with author filter
- **Morty (Session 3):** #291 Work items hierarchy — added collapsible parent/child tree with System.Parent
- **Morty (Session 4):** #292 Work items type filter — added multi-select QuickPick for Bug/Task/Feature/User Story

### Research & Architecture
- **Jaguar:** ACP deep dive — definitive protocol analysis, 3 realistic integration options, recommendation to ship Path A (terminal + events.jsonl), defer Path B (full ACP) to v0.3+
- **Jaguar:** ACP model/mode switching — UI wired, protocol calls deferred pending future ACP SDK versions

### Quality & Code Review
- **Meeseeks:** Phase 2 test coverage audit — identified 6 required test gaps (P0: watcher lifecycle; P1: edge cases)
- **Meeseeks:** ProcessPool shell quoting guidance — Windows cmd.exe constraints for integration tests
- **Rick:** Phase 2 code review — APPROVE with advisory notes (relaunchSession soft validation, unbounded retry cap, watchSessionDir dead code acceptable)

### Decisions Logged
- 10 inbox decisions merged into decisions.md
- Deduplicated; new entries append cleanly without conflicts
- Full audit trail: UUID pre-generation, ACP protocol analysis, empty state UX, terminal constants, test strategy

## Key Decisions

1. **Terminal UUID Pre-Generation (#323, #326):** Pre-generate session ID before launch; eliminates orphan detection race; immediate session tracking
2. **Phase 2 Test Gaps:** 6 additional tests required before merge; watcher lifecycle is the highest-risk surface area
3. **ACP Deferral:** Model/mode switching logged but not implemented; protocol method doesn't exist yet in ACP spec
4. **UX Empty States:** First-time users see welcome screen with clear actions; power-user "hidden" state only on return visits

## Files Modified
- `.squad/decisions.md` — 10 new entries appended (ACP analysis, terminal patterns, test gaps, UX decisions)
- `.squad/log/2026-02-22T0705-v011-completion.md` — this file

## Stale Branch Cleanup
- 133 feature branches deleted (squad/* and feature/* completed in v0.1.1)

## Next Phase (v0.2.0)
- Merge PR #385 (orphan matching + jargon + PR filtering + work items)
- Implement 6 missing Phase 2 tests from Meeseeks audit
- Evaluate pseudoterminal spike (#321) for process persistence UX
- Begin Phase 3 planning: ACP client integration
