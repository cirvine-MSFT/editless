# 2026-03-01 v0.1.3 Release Docs — Session Log

**Session:** Summer (Product Designer)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01 22:25 UTC  
**Mode:** Documentation prep  
**Outcome:** ✅ Complete

## What Happened

Summer updated all v0.1.3 release documentation to be **workflow-first**, preparing the extension for broader sharing beyond internal dogfooding.

### Files Modified

1. **CHANGELOG.md** — Added narrative intro paragraph emphasizing auto-discovery theme
2. **README.md** — Restructured features section to lead with user workflows instead of technical features
3. **docs/SETTINGS.md** — Replaced obsolete agent-registry.json docs with auto-discovery model explanation + migration notes
4. **docs/workflows/create-agent.md** — Removed references to agent registry (obsolete as of #427)

### Key Decisions

- **Workflow-first docs:** New users care about what they can DO, not what features exist
- **Narrative changelog:** Each release has a theme/personality; 0.1.3 theme is "auto-discovery released"
- **Settings migration:** Clear path for v0.1.2 → v0.1.3 (auto-migrated on first activation)
- **Personality in prose:** Docs now tell a story, not just list features

### Design Philosophy

> "Docs are product. The README is the first impression — it needs to tell a story, not just list features."

New users will now understand:
1. **What they can accomplish** via README features (user-centric framing)
2. **What changed and why** via CHANGELOG narrative intro
3. **How to configure what they need** via SETTINGS auto-discovery model

## Related Decisions

- `summer-v013-docs-polish.md` — Full design rationale
- `copilot-directive-branching-v013.md` — v0.1.3 ships from main, then branches for hotfixes
- User directive: v0.1.3 release prep for broader sharing

## Next Steps

- Merge to main after Squad approval
- Tag v0.1.3 on main
- Create `release/v0.1.x` branch for future hotfixes
