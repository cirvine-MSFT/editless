# v0.1.1 Release Kickoff Session

**Date:** 2026-02-22T03:14:00Z  
**Lead:** Rick  
**Team:** Rick (Lead), Morty (Extension Dev), Summer (Product Designer)  
**Orchestrated by:** Copilot (spawn prompt)

## Summary

Rick scoped v0.1.1 release plan (9 issues: terminal fixes, UX, work item integration). Morty began terminal constant bumps. Summer started empty state onboarding UX. Spawn coordination established concurrent parallel workstreams.

**Status:** In Progress (parallel agents active)

## Workstreams

1. **Rick (Lead)** — v0.1.1 release plan scope (SYNC, COMPLETE)
2. **Morty (Extension Dev)** — Terminal constant bumps #328 (BACKGROUND)
3. **Summer (Product Designer)** — Empty state onboarding #339 (BACKGROUND)

## Decisions Merged

- User directives on work verification (avoid redundant changes)
- EditLess scope clarification (window manager, not dashboard)

## Next Steps

1. Merge decisions into shared decisions.md
2. Monitor Morty and Summer progress
3. Create v0.1.1 GitHub issues per plan
