# Orchestration Log: Meeseeks (agent-M)

**Date:** 2026-03-01T20:34:00Z
**Duration:** ~800s (est.)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5

## Scope

Develop comprehensive unit test suite for debounce behavior, validating both TerminalManager pause/resume cycles and extension tree reveal functionality.

**Issue:** #438

## Work Done

1. Analyzed debounce requirements from Morty's implementation spec
2. Designed two test suites:
   - **TerminalManager debounce:** 12 tests for pause/resume event timing
   - **Extension reveal debounce:** 16 tests for tree reveal batching
3. Wrote and validated all 28 tests
4. Verified tests pass in isolation and integrated with main suite
5. Coordinated handoff with Morty for PR branch integration

## Findings

- TerminalManager debounce consistently delays events by configured interval
- Reveal batching correctly aggregates multiple rapid terminal changes
- Edge cases covered: cancellation, rapid re-triggers, timeout scenarios
- All tests maintain consistent naming and assertion patterns

## Output

- **File:** `debounce-behavior.test.ts`
- **Test Count:** 28 (12 TerminalManager + 16 reveal)
- **Status:** All passing ✅
- **Committed:** Via coordinator to PR #439 branch
- **Coverage:** Debounce timing, batch assembly, edge cases
