# Orchestration Log: Birdperson — v0.2 Branching Strategy

**Time:** 2026-03-01T22:08Z  
**Agent:** Birdperson (DevOps)  
**Status:** Complete

## Work Summary

Birdperson designed branching strategy to support parallel v0.1.x hotfixes and v0.2 development:

1. **Analyzed context:** PR #427 (auto-discover refactor) already merged to main; main is now v0.2 track
2. **Proposed release/v0.1.x** long-lived hotfix branch for v0.1.3+ releases
3. **Planned cherry-pick flow** from release/v0.1.x to main for shared fixes
4. **Documented in** `birdperson-v02-branching-strategy.md` for decision inbox merge

## Decisions Written

- `.squad/decisions/inbox/birdperson-v02-branching-strategy.md` — 85 lines, branching model + rationale

## Artifacts

- Git-flow branching model (release/v0.1.x for hotfixes, main for v0.2)
- Implementation commands for creating release/v0.1.x branch
- Open questions for CI workflow updates
- Worktree-aware workflow for Casey

## Status

✅ Ready for merge into decisions.md. Awaiting approval for branch creation.
