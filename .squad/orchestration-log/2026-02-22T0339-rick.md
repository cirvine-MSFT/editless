# Rick Orchestration — 2026-02-22T0339Z

**Agent:** Rick (claude-sonnet-4.5)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-22T03:39:00Z  
**Task:** Create Squad Ecosystem Integration roadmap

## Mandate

Synthesize Casey's strategic directive ("many frontends, not one") with Squad SDK/CLI stub status to plan 3-phase integration roadmap for EditLess.

## Work Done

1. **Analyzed strategic context:**
   - Brady confirmed multi-frontend approach; Fritz building SquadUI
   - @bradygaster/squad-sdk and squad-cli v0.7.0 are stubs (real code coming)
   - @github/copilot-sdk v0.1.25 production-ready (JSON-RPC foundation)
   - EditLess currently treats all sessions homogeneously

2. **Designed 3-phase integration plan:**
   - **Phase 1 (Foundation, v0.2.0):** Session modality awareness, Squad CLI builder, launch commands, attention state, icons (5 issues)
   - **Phase 2 (SDK Research, v0.2.x):** Copilot SDK spike, session discovery (2 issues)
   - **Phase 3 (Blocked):** When Brady ships real code — EventBus, RalphMonitor, HookPipeline (4 issues, backlog)

3. **Created routing table:**
   - Squad modality/CLI → Morty (extension architecture)
   - Attention state → Morty (terminal state tracking)
   - Icons → Summer (visual design)
   - Copilot SDK spike → Jaguar (SDK expertise)
   - Architecture decision → Rick (review)

4. **Documented dependencies and external blockers:**
   - Phase 1 unblocked (uses existing APIs)
   - Phase 2 starts exploration while Phase 1 ships
   - Phase 3 blocked on Brady's SDK/CLI real implementations

## Decision Artifact

**File:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/rick-squad-integration-roadmap.md`

12 GitHub issues outlined; ready for creation.

## Related Decisions

- Terminal integration synthesis (2026-02-20)
- Unified discovery (2026-02-21)

## Next Steps for Team

1. Create GitHub milestone: "Squad Ecosystem Integration"
2. File issues #1–8 in GitHub (NOW work)
3. File issues #9–12 with `release:backlog` label (BLOCKED)
4. Assign per routing table; kick off Phase 1 immediately
