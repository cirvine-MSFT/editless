## Scope
Round 2 architecture review — refactor `AgentSettingsManager` to own its file-watching lifecycle.

## Work Done
1. Refactored `AgentSettingsManager` to implement `Disposable`
2. Self-watching pattern: manager now owns file watcher lifecycle
3. Exposes `onDidChange` event for change notifications
4. Removed leaky abstraction where `extension.ts` managed watcher externally
5. Fixed FileSystemWatcher raw-path bug in new self-watching code

## Output
- Commit: 3b315c9
- Tests passing: 900 (up from 894)
- Lint: ✅ clean
- Decision logged: "Encapsulate Settings Persistence"
