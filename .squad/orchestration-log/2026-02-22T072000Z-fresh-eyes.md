# Orchestration Log — Gemini Fresh Eyes (Independent Reviewer)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-22T072000Z  
**Task:** Independent Code Review (Phase 2 Terminal Integration)  
**Status:** Completed  
**Model:** Gemini 3 Pro (Preview)  

## Summary

Independent code review of PR #385 (terminal-manager.ts, session-context.ts) conducted with fresh perspective. **1 real bug found and fixed.** 1 false positive identified and ruled out.

## Findings

### 🐛 Real Bug Found

**Issue: getAvailableOptions not stripping :f{seq} suffix from nodeIds**

**Location:** src/filtering-api.ts (getAvailableOptions method)

**Impact:** Filter dropdowns return empty results when nodeIds contain `:f{seq}` suffix. This suffix is used internally for hierarchical tree filtering but must be stripped before querying backend options.

**Fix Applied:** Coordinator applied fix in commit ddcc6a5. nodeIds now stripped of `:f{seq}` suffix before backend query.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

### ⚠️ False Positive Ruled Out

**Issue:** Case sensitivity on issue state filtering

**Concern:** PR #385 uses hardcoded 'open' string for GitHub issue state. Mismatched case could cause no results.

**Investigation:** Checked GitHub API docs and test coverage. GitHub API returns issues in lowercase 'open' state. EditLess only fetches open issues (no closed/draft states). No case-sensitivity bug.

**Status:** ✅ Ruled out (not triggered in practice)

## Code Quality Assessment

- **Architecture:** Sound
- **Error handling:** Comprehensive
- **Type safety:** Excellent (no unsafe casts)
- **Test coverage:** Well-distributed (99+ tests)

## Recommendation

Approve PR #385. Bug fix committed (ddcc6a5). Ready for merge.

## Alignment with Rick & Meeseeks

- Rick identified 3 advisory notes (non-blocking). Fresh Eyes audit independent + added depth.
- Meeseeks test audit covers the fixed bug thoroughly in new test cases.
- All three reviewers confident in PR #385 quality.
