# Orchestration Log — Rick (Lead)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-22T0715Z  
**Task:** PR #385 Code Review  
**Status:** Completed  

## Verdict

**APPROVE** ✅

Reviewed Phase 2 terminal integration (terminal-manager.ts, session-context.ts). Implementation is correct, well-tested, comprehensive. 

## Key Findings

- **8 approved areas:** UUID pre-generation, TerminalOptions config, sendText ordering, focusTerminal overload, file watching (fs.watch), resource cleanup, TypeScript quality, test coverage
- **3 advisory notes (non-blocking):**
  1. Soft validation in relaunchSession—redundant error signals (Priority: Low)
  2. Unbounded retry in watchSession.setupWatch()—lifecycle-bounded, acceptable (Priority: Low)
  3. watchSessionDir dead code—forward-looking Phase 3 API (Priority: Informational)

## Test Coverage Assessment

- terminal-manager: 99 tests ✅
- session-context: 38 tests ✅
- All Phase 2 features covered (UUID, env vars, isTransient, focusTerminal, watchSession, debounce, dispose)

## Recommendation

Merge PR #385 as-is. Advisory notes are hardening opportunities for Phase 2+, not blockers.

## Cross-Team Alignment

- Meeseeks audit (17 test gaps found, 654→671 tests) aligned with Rick findings
- Both flagged watcher lifecycle as key test area
- Morty's 99 passing tests provide confidence
