**Duration:** 659s
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5

## Scope
Runtime behavior audit for manual testing — validate Round 2 changes across real scenarios.

## Work Done
1. Traced 7 scenarios through updated code
2. Identified FileSystemWatcher raw-path bug (before Rick's fix)
3. Validated all 7 scenarios post-fix
4. Verified encapsulation refactor doesn't break extension startup flow

## Findings
- Same raw-path bug discovered independently in Rick's self-watching code (now fixed)
- All scenarios verified clean post-remediation
- Extension responsiveness to settings changes: ✅ working

## Output
- Commit: 3b315c9 (merged)
- Runtime audit: ✅ passed
