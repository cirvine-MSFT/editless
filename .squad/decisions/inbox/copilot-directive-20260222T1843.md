### 2026-02-22T18:43Z: User directive
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** EditLess should always show a default "Copilot CLI" agent in the tree, even with no squads/agents configured. This is the generic copilot CLI agent (no --agent flag). New users should never see an empty tree — they can launch a session parented to the generic agent without knowing about squads.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory
